### Hello there ğŸ‘‹

From a young age, I always had the desire to create, fix and improve things, and my development career has been just that. I've developed websites varying in sizes and complexities, from small independent companies through to large organisations. I've had the pleasure of working in many different areas within the development industry from FinTech, Creative Studios and Startups.
